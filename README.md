# 🎗️ Pinktober: Breast Cancer Classification Challenge

This notebook was developed for **Pinktober**, a Micro Club internal datathon held in October during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a robust machine learning model to classify breast cancer cases based on anonymized patient data.

## 🧩 Workflow

- **Data Exploration**: Statistical summaries and visualizations
- **Preprocessing**: Feature selection, normalization with `MinMaxScaler`
- **Modeling**: Tried Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, classification report, and metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)

## 🎯 Final Results

- Accuracy: **0.98246**
- Precision: **0.97872**
- Recall: **0.97872**
- F1-score: **0.97872**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 🤝 Context

Created and submitted during a 48-hour ML datathon organized by **Micro Club**.
